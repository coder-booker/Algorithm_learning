They are so smart. 
What I can do is to drop some fixed practices for certain algorithms. 

general: 
    1. try to do it manually once

dp: 
    1. how to defien dp[i]?
    2. how to update dp[i+1] from dp[i]?
    3. how to get the result from dp?
    some abstract mindset: 
        how to keep transfer the state? (states can be +ve or -ve states that benefit or harm the result respectively)

moving windows:
    1. when to move left and right?
    2. when to stop moving left and right?
    3. how to update the result?
